// Test setup file
// TODO: Decide on testing framework
// Option 1: Vitest (faster, Vite-native)
// Option 2: Jest (more established, larger ecosystem)
// Option 3: Testing Library + Vitest (recommended for React)

// This file is created but tests are not written yet
// FIXME: Need to set up test environment and write tests
