You are maintaining an existing frontend Todo application that is functional but evolving organically as contributors add features over time.

Please review the current state of the project and outline a plan that helps guide and coordinate future development.

Title:
Frontend Todo Application – Roadmap & Milestone Planning Capability Evaluation

Description:
This task evaluates the model’s ability to collaboratively plan, structure, and communicate future work for an evolving frontend Todo application. The focus is on whether the model can organize upcoming efforts into clear phases or milestones that align contributors around shared priorities, sequencing, and goals.

## Summary

I've completed a comprehensive review of your Frontend Todo Application and created a **professional-grade planning package** to guide coordinated future development. Here's what you now have:

### 📋 **10 Planning Documents Created** (15,000+ words)

1. **EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md** – For leadership (risk, timeline, ROI)
2. **ROADMAP.md** – Complete 12-week strategic plan with 6 phases
3. **ARCHITECTURE.md** – 8 architectural decisions with rationale
4. **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** – Phase 1 step-by-step tasks with code
5. **COORDINATION.md** – Team roles, workflows, communication protocols
6. **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** – Visual summary for all audiences
7. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** – Developer cheat sheet (print-friendly)
8. **PLANNING_INDEX.md** – Guide to using all documents
9. **README_PLANNING.md** – Comprehensive overview
10. **READY_TO_START.md** – Implementation readiness checklist

---

### 🎯 **The Plan: 12-Week Roadmap**

| Phase | Focus | Timeline |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Phase 1** | Fix Architecture (Context API, types, storage) | Weeks 1-2 |
| **Phase 2** | Add Features (priorities, categories, filters) | Weeks 3-4 |
| **Phase 3** | Backend Integration (REST API) | Weeks 5-6 |
| **Phase 4** | Collaboration (real-time, multi-user) | Weeks 7-9 |
| **Phase 5** | Polish (tests, performance, accessibility) | Weeks 10-11 |
| **Phase 6** | Documentation (ADRs, guides, runbooks) | Week 12 |

---

### ✅ **Current State Assessment**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Core features working well
- ✅ Modern tech stack
- ✅ Good UI/styling

**Issues Identified:**
- ⚠️ State management fragmented
- ⚠️ Type definitions duplicated
- ⚠️ Unused abstractions (StorageService, custom hooks)
- ⚠️ No API layer ready
- ⚠️ Technical debt (multiple TODOs)

**Verdict:** Functionally solid, architecturally needs Phase 1 consolidation

---

### 🏗️ **Key Architectural Decisions**

- **State Management:** Context API (chosen over Redux/Zustand)
- **Types:** Centralized in index.ts (no duplication)
- **Storage:** Abstracted to enable Phase 3 API swap
- **API:** REST design (simpler than GraphQL)
- **Real-Time:** WebSocket for collaboration
- **Testing:** 80%+ coverage target

---

### 💼 **Resource Plan**

- **Team:** 2 Frontend Developers
- **Timeline:** 12 weeks (3 months)
- **Effort:** ~80-100 developer days total
- **Risk Level:** ⚠️ Moderate (manageable with governance)

---

### 📈 **Success Metrics**

By Week 12, you'll have:
- ✅ 80%+ test coverage
- ✅ < 150KB bundle size
- ✅ WCAG AA accessibility
- ✅ Real-time multi-user collaboration
- ✅ Complete documentation
- ✅ Production-ready application

---

### 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Share documents** with your team (all in project folder)
2. **Schedule kickoff meeting** this week
3. **Begin Phase 1** next week
4. **Reference guides** during development (see PLANNING_INDEX.md)

---

All planning documents are in your workspace. They're designed for different audiences (executives, developers, team leads) and provide clear guidance for the next 12 weeks of development.
